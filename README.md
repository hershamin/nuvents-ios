# NuVents
Nuvents aims to connect like-minded people by facilitating offline-interactions through a location-based event creation, discovery and communications platform.

Our product is a mobile-focused approach to event creation and discovery, giving event organizers and attendees the ability to communicate and share event-related content in real-time. We believe that event organizers will be able to better target a larger pool of attendees who happen to be nearby and/or who have communicated genuine interest for the event to the organizers within our app. Aside from curating interesting events in a city, we think our platform can enable people to come together around similar interests through our immediate approach (notifications, location-based prompts) to organizer/attendee interaction.

Our initial target user is a millennial who has recently moved to, or is visiting, an urban city of influence and who is looking to meet people with similar interests.
